        <h2>Don't You See Marty? We Have to Go Back!</h2>
        <p><span class='author'>by <a href='about:blank' target="_blank">Robert Zemeckis</a></span></p>

        <p>Who the hell is John F. Kennedy? I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available at every corner drug store, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by. Marty, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you're stuck here. Yoo. I'm gonna be at the dance. Weight has nothing to do with it.

        You cost three-hundred buck damage to my car, you son-of-a-bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass. Hold him. Marty, will we ever see you again? What, well you mean like a date? Hey not too early I sleep in Sunday's, hey McFly, you're shoe's untied, don't be so gullible, McFly. yes, Joey just loves being in his playpen. he cries whenever we take him out so we just leave him in there all the time. Well Marty, I hope you like meatloaf.

        Uh, well, I haven't finished those up yet, but you know I figured since they weren't due till- Right. Flux capacitor. Well uh, good, fine. There, there, now, just relax. You've been asleep for almost nine hours now.</p>
