          <p>What's going on? Where have you been all week? I'd like you to meet my good friend George McFly. Wow, ah Red, you look great. Everything looks great. 1:24, I still got time. Oh my god. No, no not again, c'mon, c'mon. Hey. Libyans. You know Marty, I'm gonna be very sad to see you go. You've really mad a difference in my life, you've given me something to shoot for. Just knowing, that I'm gonna be around to se 1985, that I'm gonna succeed in this. That I'm gonna have a chance to travel through time. It's going to be really hard waiting 30 years before I could talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty. I know, and all I could say is I'm sorry.</p>

          <p>
            God dammit, I'm late. Don't pay any attention to him, he's in one of his moods. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing, come in here to dinner. Now let's see, you already know Lorraine, this is Milton, this is Sally, that's Toby, and over there in the playpen is little baby Joey. This sounds pretty heavy. Is she pretty? You can't, uh, that is, uh, nobody's home.
          </p>

          <p>
            Perfect, just perfect. Yeah, I think maybe you do. Listen, I gotta go but I wanted to tell you that it's been educational. Hey Marty, I'm not your answering service, but you're outside pouting about the car, Jennifer Parker called you twice. Check out that four by four. That is hot. Someday, Jennifer, someday. Wouldn't it be great to take that truck up to the lake. Throw a couple of sleeping bags in the back. Lie out under the stars.

            His head's gone, it's like it's been erased. oh yeah, all you gotta do is go over there and ask her. It's a board with wheels. But I can't go to the dance, I'll miss my favorite television program, Science Fiction Theater. Precisely.
          </p>
          <p>  Oh, hi , Marty. I didn't hear you come in. Fascinating device, this video unit. Uh? Whoa, whoa, kid, kid, stop, stop, stop, stop. Uh, look me up when you get there. Right, George. Well, good luck you guys. Oh, one other thing, if you guys ever have kids and one of them when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug, be easy on him.</p>
          <p>  Alright, punk, now- Hi. I don't know, but I'm gonna find out. Marty, this may seem a little foreward, but I was wondering if you would ask me to the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance on Saturday. Good, I'll see you tonight. Don't forget, now, 1:15 a.m., Twin Pines Mall.</p>
